    "# Vectorial Word Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Representing words as dense vectors over a finite-dimensional space was one of the recent breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing. Vectorial representations allow space-efficient, informationally rich storage of words that adequately captures their semantic content and enables numerical computation on them. Word vectors are the standard input representation for machine learning architectures for language processing. Even though new methods for constructing such representations emerge frequently, the original set of published papers remain a de facto point of reference as well as a good starting point. For this assignment, you will be asked to implement a small-scale variant of one such paper, namely [Global Word Vectors for Word Representation](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) (\"the GloVe paper\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the code and data pre-processing has already been done for you. Additionally, notes on the paper will appear throughout the notebook to guide you along the code. It is, however, important to read and understand the paper, its terminology and the theory behind it before attempting to go through with the assignment. Some of the tasks will also require addressing the paper directly.\n",
    "\n",

    "There are 2 types of tasks in this assignment: \n",
    "- coding tasks --- 10 tasks worth 1 point each --- asking you to write code following specifications provided; make sure to <ins>show the code to your teacher after completing every coding task</ins>\n",
    "- interpretation questions --- 5 questions worth 1 point each --- asking you to interpret the data or the results of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "You are greatly encouraged to add comments to your code describing what particular lines of code do (in general, a great habit to have in your coding life), as well as self-check regularly by printing your tensors and their shapes making sure they look adequate."

    "## Corpus Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper's proposed model, GloVe, aims to densely represent words in a way that captures the global corpus statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The construction it encodes is the word __co-occurrence matrix__. A co-occurrence matrix is a simplistic data structure that counts the number of times each word has appeared within the context of every other word. The definition of a context varies; usually, context is implied to be a fixed-length span (that may or may not be allowed to escape sentence boundaries) around a word. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in the sentence below and for a context length of 2, the word <span style=\"color:pink\">__Earth__</span> occurs in the context of <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">made</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">on</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">as</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">an</span> (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"He struck most of the friends he had <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">made on</span> <span style=\"color:pink\">__Earth__</span> <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">as an</span> eccentric\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the word <span style=\"color:pink\">__friends__</span> occurs in the context of <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">of</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">the</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">he</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">had</span> (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"He struck most <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">of the</span> <span style=\"color:pink\">__friends__</span> <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">he had</span> made on Earth as an eccentric\"\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative definition of a context would be, for instance, the variable-length windows spanned by a full sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contexts may be summed across sentences or entire corpora; the summed context of <span style=\"color:pink\">he</span> in the example sentence is: <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">struck</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">most</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">the</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">friends</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">had</span> (1), <span style=\"color:lightgreen\">made</span> (1).\n",

    "2. > The distinction between a word and a context word is arbitrary and we are free to exchange the two roles. To do so consistently, we must not only exchange $w \\leftrightarrow \\tilde{w}$ but also $X \\leftrightarrow X^T$.\n",
    "3. > It should be well-defined for all values in $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these three constraints, each word $i$ in our vocabulary is represented by four vectors:\n",
